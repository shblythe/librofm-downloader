# Libro.fm Audiobook Downloader

Small tool for checking your [libro.fm](https://libro.fm) library and downloading new books.

The tool is set to recheck the library every day and download new books. Books will be skipped if the `Author Name/Book Name` folder already exists.

## Extra Features

### Rename Chapters
Enable `RENAME_CHAPTERS` to rename files from `Track - #.mp3` to `### <Book Title> - <Chapter Title>` as provided by libro.fm
Additionally, if you enable `WRITE_TITLE_TAG`, each track's ID3 `title` field will be set to `### <Chapter Title>` as provided by libro.fm.

### Convert to M4B

M4B is an audio book file format that is supported by many players. By default, libro.fm on;y supports downloading "chapterized" MP3 files i.e. every chapter is its own file.
That's not very convenient and also not supported by tons of players.
If you enable `CONVERT_TO_M4B` or pass the `--convert-to-m4b` flag, a separate m4b file will be generated with all the available metadata (e.g. chapter names and a book cover).
The MP3 files are not deleted when the process is completed.
Note: this process will take a little extra time to complete.

When running this tool separately (i.e. not using the provided docker container), please ensure `ffmpeg` is installed on your system.
You can pass the paths for `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` to the tool as well using the `--ffmpeg-path <path>` and `--ffprobe-path <path>` options.

### API Server
After the initial download of your library, the container will run a API server.
Bind a host port to `8080` to access the services.

Endpoints:
- `/update` allows you to manually force a refresh (ie: when you just purchased a book).
- `/convertToM4b/{isbn}` allows you to selectively convert audiobooks from MP3 to M4B by passing the book's ISBN. If you pass `all` it will convert ALL books. Note: Books that already have a `.m4b` file will be skipped.
