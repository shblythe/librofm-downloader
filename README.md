# Libro.fm Audiobook Downloader

Small tool for checking your [libro.fm](https://libro.fm) library and downloading new books.

The tool is set to recheck the library every hour and download new books. Books will be skipped if the `Author Name/Book Name` folder already exists.

## Extra Features

enable `RENAME_CHAPTERS` to rename files from `Track - #.mp3` to `### <Book Title> - <Chapter Title>` as provided by libro.fm

enable `WRITE_TITLE_TAG` to update each track's ID3 `title` field to `### <Chapter Title>` as provided by libro.fm.

bind a host port to `8080` to access the service's `/update` webhook. This allows you to manually force a refresh (ie: when you just purchased a book).
